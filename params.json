However, the CMS (Content Management System) part brings many benefits to people without any programming skills.\r\n<br /><br />\r\n\r\n## Some of SBND F&CMS advantages:\r\n\r\n**- Fast Custom Programing.**\r\nAllows you to build and register your own components with custom functionality within minutes.\r\nThe real power of SBND F&CMS is the easy creation of such Components, having custom functionality and in accordance with your concrete project needs. \r\n\r\n**- Using Native PHP Classes & Functions.**\r\nWe were careful not to use any extensions that might bring difficulties for future upgrades or migrations. Of course, this guarantees the high performance too.\r\n\r\n**- Extra Components For The Most Common Web Features.**\r\nAvailable for download and ready to use in your projects. Configured within minutes by following simple installation instructions.\r\n\r\n**- Built-In Database Engine.**\r\nHas built-in engine for generating database tables and fields based on the structure defined for the module, so no manually creation and database tables and fields are needed. No need of knowing SQL syntax.\r\n\r\n**- Feed Data To Your Mobile App.**\r\nSBND F&CMS could be used as a Back End or a \"feeder\" for mobile or other \"outside\" applications. It could be configured to output data in XML or JSON format instead of the built-in HTML format.\r\n\r\n**- Easy CMS Configuration.**\r\nAll useful settings are put in one place only. No doubts of what they mean or are used for.\r\n\r\n**- User-Friendly Back End.**\r\nAfter years of experience with working with the explicit needs of our end clients we have created the most intuitive and simple interface to work with CMS and Components features. \r\n\r\n**- Automated Multilingual Support.**\r\nAbility to add unlimited number of languages by simply entering a few fields from the Back End interface. SBND F&CMS takes care of multiplying the UI for any language added as well as updating all database tables accordingly.\r\n\r\n**- Easy To Prepare Your Own Design.**\r\nSample \"responsive\", \"modern\" and \"mobile\" design themes are available and could be very helpful in preparing custom designs ready to be used. These themes are compatible with most common web browsers and are scalable for mobile devices, tablets, etc.\r\n\r\n**- Template Engine.**\r\nUse a simple built-in Template Engine to apply Front End logic where needed.\r\n\r\n**- SEO Readiness.**\r\nThe downloaded instance is ready for future SEO activities. It takes care of many SEO requirements in advance, such as user-friendly links, page titles, meta words, meta descriptions. The framework automatically generates required for the search engine robots files, sitemap files, files that help Google find the website, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n=========\r\n\r\n## Ready-to-use Components:\r\n\r\n\r\n=========\r\nSo-called “Components” have similar meaning like “Plug-ins”, “Modules” or “Extensions” for other popular software. These are already implemented pieces of software with particular functionality, ready to be “register” into F&CMS and therefore ready to be used for your projects.
